# Python Farming Game
## What is this?
This is going to be my last project in the programming 2 course that I'm studying in school. 
The game is supposed to be a pixel art style game where the objective is to have your own small farm that you are going to take care of. To add some interesting mechanics I'm going to add weather to the game. But this weather is not like any other weather, no no, this weather is based on the weather at the location that you are playing the game. So if it is sunny outside there is going to be sunny in the game and if it is raining outside there will be raining in the game as well. 

## Core Mechanics 
To keep this project on the smaller scale I'm going to have a small amount of mechanics and I'm going to keep them quite simple. 
The core mechanics will be : 
 
* Growing crops on soil
* Watering the crops 
* Harvesting the crops
* Selling the crops
* Buy new crops and items
